                    1. Cleaning: Dust and clean your furniture regularly. Use a soft cloth or
                    a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush to remove dust, fluff and dirt. Avoid that
                    use aggressive cleaning agents as they can damage the furniture surface. <br> <br>
                    
                    2. Stains and spills: If you spill liquid or get a stain on your furniture,
                    you must act quickly. Use a clean cloth or paper towel to dry
                    up before it penetrates the wood or upholstery. If necessary,
                    you can use a mild detergent intended for the specific material. <br> <br>

                    4. Protection from sunlight: Avoid placing your furniture in a place where it will be exposed
                    for prolonged periods of direct sunlight. UV rays can fade and damage the wood finish
                    or the fabric on upholstered furniture. Use curtains, blinds or sun protection for
                    to protect your furniture from the sun.

                    When choosing furniture style for your home, it is important to consider
                    your personal taste, the overall design of the room and
                    the functionality of the furniture. You can consider creating a coherent
                    style by choosing furniture that matches the architectural style of the room
                    elements and color scheme. Explore different styles like
                    modern, classic, rustic, minimalist, etc. and look what
                    that best suits your aesthetics and needs.

                <h3 class="answtxt">
                    To ensure that the furniture fits well in your room, you must measure both the width and the height
                    and the depth of the accessible area. Use a measuring tape and make sure to measure from wall to wall
                    wall. Remember to also take into account any doors, windows or other obstacles there
                    can affect the placement of the furniture. It is also a good idea to make a sketch of the room
                    and the measurements so you can visualize how the furniture will fit.

                    Caring for furniture depends on the material. In general, it is recommended to vacuum or dry
                    the furniture regularly to remove dust and dirt. Use suitable cleaning agents and methods
                    to the specific material, e.g. wood polishing for wooden furniture or leather cleaner for leather furniture.
                    Avoid direct sunlight, excess heat and humidity, as this can affect the appearance of the furniture and
                    durability. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for care and cleaning of your specific furniture.

                    When it comes to outdoor furniture, materials such as aluminum, teak, synthetic fibers (e.g.
                    rattan or polyrattan) and stainless steel are popular choices. These materials are known for their resilience
                    against weather conditions such as sun, rain and humidity. It is also recommended to choose furniture with weather resistance
                    cushions and covers that are easy to clean or can be removed and washed.
